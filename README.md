<img src="poker_scale_overview.JPG" alt="Poker Scale Overview" width="150"/>

## Overview
This Arduino-based poker scale is a custom-built system designed to simplify the process of summing poker chip values during games. The scale combines precision electronics and customizable software to deliver a highly functional and user-friendly experience. Built on an Arduino platform, it integrates 3D-printed chassis components, load cell technology, and intuitive controls to create a reliable and efficient tool for poker enthusiasts.



## Key Features
- **4-Digit 7-Segment Displays**: Four vibrant, easy-to-read 7-segment displays provide a clear and concise output of the calculated chip sum.
- **Load Cells and HX711**: Utilizes four 1kg load cells connected to an HX711 amplifier for accurate weight measurement.
- **Customizable Chip Values**: A user-friendly menu allows players to adjust the monetary value assigned to each chip color.
- **Calibration Options**: Recalibrate chip weights to ensure long-term accuracy.
- **Preset Chip Types**: Save and load default weight profiles for different types of poker chips, making setup quick and consistent.
- **Dual Button Interface**: Includes a **Tare** button for resetting the scale and a **Menu** button for accessing settings.
- **3D-Printed Chassis**: A durable and custom-designed chassis houses all components, ensuring portability and style.

## Components
1. **Arduino Microcontroller**: The brain of the system.
2. **4 x 4-Digit 7-Segment Displays**: Displays the calculated chip sum.
3. **HX711 Amplifier**: Interfaces with the load cells to provide precise measurements.
4. **4 x 1kg Load Cells**: Ensures accurate weight detection for poker chips.
5. **3D-Printed Chassis**: Custom design to fit the scale's hardware components.
6. **2 x Buttons**: Tactile buttons for Tare and Menu functionality.

## Functionality
### Tare Function
The Tare button resets the scale, ensuring precise measurements even if residual weight remains on the platform.

### Menu Options
The Menu button provides access to:
- **Chip Value Adjustment**: Modify the assigned value of each chip color.
- **Weight Recalibration**: Update the weight measurements for accurate readings.
- **Default Profiles**: Save and switch between different preset chip types.

## Assembly and Setup
1. **3D-Printed Chassis**: Print the chassis parts using the provided 3D model files.
2. **Load Cell Installation**: Secure the four 1kg load cells to the chassis.
3. **Electronics Integration**: Connect the load cells to the HX711 and then to the Arduino.
4. **Display Connection**: Wire the 7-segment displays to the Arduino.
5. **Button Placement**: Attach the Tare and Menu buttons to the chassis.
6. **Power Up**: Load the Arduino code and power the device.
